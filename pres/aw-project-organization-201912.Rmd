Hi everyone, thank you, etc. 

Clone the project in and compile all.

Reproducibility x organization.

Inspiration: jenny bryan, jim, Not so standard deviations 2016

Clearly been thought about a lot before -- this is nothing new!

So this is more *descriptive*, and less *prescriptive*; 

I wasn't taught this in school, and if you're like me it would have been nice to
get more exposure to this

## Grad school code

What's especially wrong with it?

*Modus operandi*

> "I'm the only one who's going to *really* use this, so I can be lazy about the organization."


## Bad design

*Probably* not reproducible

* Not especially well documented, particularly at first
* Ambiguity in file naming & authoritative versions
* Projects aren't self-contained
* Nothing about R install or packages were recorded!
* Hard paths, etc.

## Tools 

and their "induced philosophies"

`git`, `.Rproj`, `make`, `renv`

<aside class='notes'>
I picked up a number of tools along the way, and I feel

### Characteristics of implementations <br /> leading to good project design

* Intentional
* Codified
* Explicit 


## Project evolution

![](../img/proj-plot.png)

<aside class='notes'>
Started using git around 2018, after a project under my belt.

## Project evolution

![](../img/whale-fruit-fly-plot.png)

<aside class='notes'>
My projects life spans had turned from whales to fruit flies;

Evolution could occur much more rapidly.

Setup script made me really consider what my projects looked like.
</aside>

## `git`

<img src="https://s24255.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Git.png" height = 200px>

## `git`

* ESSENTIAL to any workflow, collaborative or otherwise
* Reduces or eliminates uncertainty in code changes over time
* A feeling of safety to build upon code -- nothing is lost!

## `git` and intentionality

* Introducing objects into the repository is a **deliberate** process
    * What files are worth putting into the repo?
    * If they aren't entered in, do others depend on it?
    * Do you have a way to get it to them somehow?
* Eliminates dependence on `v1.0`, `v2.0`, `Archive/`, `Old/` etc.

Paraphrased:

> git slows you down, but in a good way that makes you think about the project <br/> -- Roger Peng, Not So Standard Deviations

## `git` and codification

* Commit message, tags, GitHub all allow commentary to build on code.
* Commit messages are **required**; the committer must consider
the implications of changes at least once.
* GitHub really encourages the use of README files


## `git` and explicitness

* Plenty of space to write
* Code history is its own explicit record

## `git`

## R projects / packages

![](images/rproj.png)

## R projects / packages

Intentional: 

* Requires the user to define an entry point for their project
* Packges impose a regular structure on the folders contained in a project

Codified:

* `.Rproj` clearly demarcates an R project, and itself contains some settings about the project.

Explicit: 

* R projects and packages discourage the use of absolute paths (`{here}`)
* R projects and packages discourage cross-folder project structures

## `renv`

Released 2019-10-26 (?) -- Kevin Ushey author, maintainer

Succeeds `packrat`

Package management system

Reproducibility miracle

## `renv` usage

```r
# Initialize the project with some folders, changes to .Rprofile, etc.
renv::init()

# Take snapshots of the package dependencies at intervals
renv::snapshot()

# From another workstation, after cloning
renv::restore()
```

## `renv`

Intentional:

* `renv::consent()` a literal function in the package
* Forces the user to confront what packages are necessary for the project

## `renv`

Codified:

* `renv::snapshot()` aids the user in writing down the R version, the CRAN repository, and package versions
* Could have been done before (`sessionInfo()`), but try restoring from that!

## `renv`

Instead:

```{r}
cat(paste0(readLines('renv.lock'), collapse = '\n'))
```

## `renv`

Explicit:

* Package versions and sources are *exact*
* Can specify non-standard repositories (i.e. GitHub)

## `GNU make`

## `GNU make`

My favorite workflow addition

Software from April 1973

Orchestrates the creation of **targets** by evaluating **dependencies'**
modification times, using **recipes** written by you.

*(Also see `drake`)*

## `GNU make`

<div class=bigcode>
```
target: dependency_1 dependency_2 dependency_n
    recipe
```
</div>

## `GNU make`

The makefile that determines this very project!

```{r}
cat(paste0(readLines('makefile'), collapse = '\n'))
```

## `GNU make`

I:

* The workflow is deliberately constructed.
* Forces the user to confront the reproducibility of the project.
    * If you can't `make all` from scratch, your pipeline is broken!

C:

* The workflow is **written down**.
    * Much better than lexical ordering (i.e. `01_load.R`, `02_clean.R`, `03_analyze.R`).

E:

* The workflow is **precise**
    * All inputs and outputs are defined, and the chain of events are elaborated in great detail.
    
## `GNU make`

UNIX software design philosophy

* Write programs that do one thing and do it well.
* Write programs to work together.
